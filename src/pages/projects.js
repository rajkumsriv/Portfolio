    title: "Chronicle SIEM Deployment",
    details: `
<span class="text-lg font-bold">üßæ Project Overview</span>
Led and successfully executed the enterprise-wide migration of a U.S.-based financial services firm from IBM QRadar to Google Chronicle SIEM. This initiative aimed to modernize the organization's threat detection capabilities, reduce operational overhead, and enable high-speed, cloud-native analytics across security operations.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">üõ†Ô∏è What Was Done</span>
End-to-end Deployment of Google Chronicle as the centralized SIEM platform across all business units and geographic locations.
Data Onboarding: Integrated diverse log sources‚Äîfirewalls, proxies, EDRs, DLP, cloud, and application logs‚Äîinto Chronicle using custom parsers and ingestion pipelines.
Custom Dashboards: Delivered role-based dashboards for SOC analysts, threat hunters, and CISOs, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK and use-case-specific KPIs.
Detection Engineering: Built and fine-tuned YARA-L rules to create robust and scalable threat detection logic tailored to the organization's risk profile.
Threat Intelligence Integration: Ingested external threat intel feeds and mapped them to real-time detection pipelines.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">‚öôÔ∏è How It Was Done</span>
Discovery & Planning Phase: Assessed existing QRadar architecture and detection gaps. Collaborated with stakeholders to define migration scope and critical use cases.
Data Normalization: Developed and validated parsers to normalize log formats for Chronicle‚Äôs UDM (Unified Data Model).
Security Use Case Mapping: Translated QRadar correlation rules into Chronicle's YARA-L syntax, improving detection logic accuracy.
Operational Readiness Testing: Conducted UAT, threat simulations, and alert testing with blue team and incident response teams.
Training & Handover: Delivered technical documentation, and conducted enablement sessions for internal teams.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">üöß Challenges Faced</span>
Legacy data inconsistencies and custom QRadar rules with limited documentation.
Log source compatibility issues with Chronicle‚Äôs ingestion requirements.
Organizational resistance to tool transition‚Äîrequired stakeholder buy-in and team training.
Detection tuning to reduce false positives in the early stages of migration.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">‚úÖ Key Benefits & Outcomes</span>
80% reduction in infrastructure overhead due to Chronicle's serverless, cloud-native design.
Improved detection coverage and alert quality through enriched context and tailored YARA-L rules.
Achieved 98% log source onboarding within agreed timelines.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">üîç Observations</span>
Unified Data Model significantly improves cross-platform correlation and search performance.
SOC teams became more agile post-deployment due to faster alert triage and improved visualization.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">üìò Lessons Learned</span>
Early involvement of SOC teams accelerates adoption and reduces change resistance.
Automated validation scripts and playbooks reduce onboarding errors and ensure consistency.
Real-time collaboration between detection engineers, threat hunters, and cloud architects is key to success in SIEM transformations.

<span class="text-lg font-bold">üèÜ Achievement Highlight</span>
Delivered a fully operational, cloud-native SIEM solution in under 12 weeks, positioning the organization for next-gen security operations with scalable threat detection, reduced TCO, and high-speed analytics‚Äîwell ahead of projected timelines.
